I tried to play aroud features in tagger.py to improve percepton tagger for portuguese language. 
Firstly, I tried to change each number in get_features, make it larger or smaller to see what happens. 
I find out that if I change the length of the suffix from -4 to -3 in this feature: (add('i suffix', word[-3:])) it works better snd result chsnges from 92.76 to 93.19.
Changing anything in the other features only make the result worse.
Secondly, I tried to add new features to see what happens if we take different length of suffixes.
This feature: (add('i suffix', word[-4:])) improve the result from 93.19 to 95.09.
This feature: (add('i suffix', word[-5:])) improve the result from 93.19 to 95.22.
Then I tried them both tougeter the result was improved from 93.19 to 95.93.
Feature (add('i suffix', word[-2:])) change the result from 95.93 to 95.92.
